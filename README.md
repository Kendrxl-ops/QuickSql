QuickSQL is a simple MSSQL query tool that allows you to connect to a SQL server that you already have credentials for and execute raw queries. You do not need to install the ODBC drivers for Windows and this works without administrative level permissions. 

There are two files, the quicksql.py which is the source code for quicksql and can be run on anything that has Python3 installed on it. The second is quicksql.exe which can be run on Windows operating systems.

Example:

quicksql.exe -ip 192.168.5.5 -db blank -un test -pw test -port 1433

Or run help for the parameter names:

quicksql.exe -h
